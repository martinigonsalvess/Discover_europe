          <h2>Settlers of Europe:</h2>
          <p>
            The first humans are thought to have arrived in Europe around 37,020
            years ago. They first started to develop trade and technology many
            years later around 4720 years ago during the bronze age. However,
            the technology then was not how we know it today mostly focusing on
            metallurgy and agriculture. In addition A few of the ethnic groups
            had a major influence on the region such as the greek tribes and the
            germanic and italic (or Roman) people. The population in the region
            was then vastly affected by the Vikings, Mongols, and a few other
            settlers.
